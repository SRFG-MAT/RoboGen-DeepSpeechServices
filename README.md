# Speech to text with DeepSpeech (SST) and text to speech (TTS)

## Introduction
The aim of the project is to provide functionality for a SST and TTS module. These modules are programmed in a resource-saving way in order to provide increased performance on the target system, which is a raspberry pi 3. A more detailled information of these two modules will be provided, for the STT service [here](https://github.com/TTMVP-AT/STT_TTS_Services/tree/main/STT) and for the TTS service [here](https://github.com/TTMVP-AT/STT_TTS_Services/tree/main/TTS).
